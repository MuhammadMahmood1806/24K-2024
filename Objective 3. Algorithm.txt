Objective 3. Algorithm
Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

1.Ask user for N
2.Ask user for n
3.Check if n%N = 0
4.If n%N = 0
5.Display “N is a divisor of n”
	a.if N%2 = 0
		i.Display “N is even”
	b.Else
		i.Display “N is odd”
6.IF n%N is not 0
7.Display  “N is not a divisor of n”

Task 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

1.Ask user for num1
2.Ask user for operator (+,-,*,/,%)
3.Ask user for num2
4.If operator = +
	a.Display num1+num2
5.If operator = -
	a.Display num1-num2
6.If operator = *
	a.Display num1*num2
7.If operator = /
	a.Display num1/num2
8.If operator = %
	a.Display num1%num2
